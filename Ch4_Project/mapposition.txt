Description of the OSM extract:
I chose the rural district of Neustadt an der Aisch-Bad Windsheim, Germany as the basis for data wrangling. It is my home county and it contains my dairy farm and my fields, so I have a personal relationship with that corner of the earth. As I grew up there, I think I know the peculiarities of the region pretty well. 
For a small introduction to this district, please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neustadt_(Aisch)-Bad_Windsheim

I used Mapzen for extracting the data. My custom extract was created on 2017 November 02, at 06:25 PM. The uncompressed file is ca. 350MB.
